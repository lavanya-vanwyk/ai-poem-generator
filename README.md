# AI Poem Generator built with AI API and JavaScript plugins

This AI Poem Generator application uses the SheCodes AI API to generate a poem based on a user prompt and displays it in the interface I built.

## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a functional and beautiful poem generator using an AI model. Styled dynamically with my personal UI/UX design style and the [Typewriter.js plugin](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs), I aimed to create a comfortable and engaging user experience by utilising animation and visual effects. This project was also deployed and is live hosted by Netlify.

## Tech stack & tools

* JavaScript ES6
* Bootstrap 4.5.3
* Prettier 11.0.0.
* SheCodes Weather API
* Font Awesome
* Netlify
* Aseprite

## Running instructions

Clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com//lavanya-vanwyk/ai-poem-generator.git`

Enter the project directory:

`cd ai-poem-generator`

Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

Type in the search bar a one-word or multi-word prompt. The generated poem will begin rendering as if typed out and is complete when signed off "by SheCodes AI" at the end.

You can type a new prompt to regenerate a new poem, or refresh the page.

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes and the creator of the [Typewriter.js plugin](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) for enabling me with this amazing learning opportunity.
