# AI Poem Generator built with AI API and JavaScript plugins

This AI Poem Generator application uses the SheCodes AI API to generate a poem based on a user prompt and displays it in the interface I built.

## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a functional and beautiful poem generator using an AI model. Styled dynamically with my personal UI/UX design style and the [Typewriter.js plugin](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs), I aimed to create a comfortable and engaging user experience by utilising animation and visual effects. This project was also deployed and is live hosted by Netlify.

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes and the creator of the [Typewriter.js plugin](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs) for enabling me with this amazing learning opportunity.
